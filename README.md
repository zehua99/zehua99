Hello friendly strangers, I’m Zehua.

🔬&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m a research fellow at [@StanfordLaw](https://twitter.com/StanfordLaw). Before that, I studied misinformation at [@MichiganNLP](https://github.com/MichiganNLP).  
🌊&nbsp;&nbsp;I build [surge.fm](https://github.com/surgefm), a crowdsourcing news tracking platform.  
📖&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a K-12 officer at [@tbpmig](https://github.com/tbpmig). I build web-based educational thingies for kids.  
🚗&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a software engineer intern at [@argoai](https://github.com/argoai), an autonomous vehicle company.  
✨&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to teach at a rural high school in Hainan and intern at [@nytimes](https://github.com/nytimes) Beijing Bureau.  
👨🏻‍💻&nbsp;&nbsp;You can find my resume [here](https://zehua.li/resume).  
🍵&nbsp;&nbsp;My favorate poem is _“Useless”_ by Weitang Liao:
>&nbsp;_即使是这样_  
>&nbsp;_我们仍然相信自己活着，_  
>&nbsp;_相信灵魂是幻肢，仍然骑车穿过广场。_  
>&nbsp;_暴雨的列阵仍然找不到般配的骑手。_

Peace! ✌️
